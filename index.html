            <h2>About Black Panther</h2>
            <p>The second installment of Marvel Universe's Black Panther makes a return in early 2021. The late Chadwick Boseman continues as the king of Wakanda, T'Challa. Lupita Nyong'o, Letitia Wright, Angela Basset and Winston Duke all make a return in this sequel.</p>
            
            <p>T'Challa thought that all the evil and fighting was behind him until a new enemy threatens his throne and Wakanda once again. An enemy stronger and closer to him than he could have ever imagined. Can he gather all Wakandians and defeat the man who has potential to destroy his people?</p>
